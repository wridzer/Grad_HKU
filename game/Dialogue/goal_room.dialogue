~ day_1_room
The room sprawls out before you, stairs already visible. A sense of relief washes over you, you somehow made it to the end.

=> END 

~ day_2_room
You can feel it in your entire being, this is the final room.
Something in you feels almost sad to leave this place. It's a nagging feeling, as if you have been here before...
